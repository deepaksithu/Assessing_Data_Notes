## Overview
In these notes three datasets containing example medical record information about a new treatment are analyzed. The datasets are `adverse_reactions.csv` which contains patient first and last names as well as listed adverse reactions they experienced from the treatment, `patients.csv`  which contains patient information such as gender, address, and phone number, and `treatments.csv` which shows patient first and last name as well as which treatment they received and what their hba1c levels were at the start and end. The `common-programmatic-assessments.ipynb` file contains notes on common programmatic assessments in `pandas` which can be used on dataframes. In the `assessing.ipynb` file the datasets are visually and programmatically assessed to then be cleaned.

## Requirements
This code depends on the `pandas` library.

In addition to these, the Jupyter Notebook assumes that the data sets `adverse_reactions.csv`, `patients.csv`, and `treatments.csv` have been extracted and are in the project folder.

The Binder badge above can be used to explore an executable environment for the `assessing.ipynb` file.

## Issues

- organize files out of folder
- save cleaned dataset as .csv
- review notes
